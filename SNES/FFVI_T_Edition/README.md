# How to use

1. Open up BizHawk; boot up your file for `FF6 T-Edition`
1. Go to Tools >> Lua Console
1. Drag-and-drop the "FF6_holy_dragon_HP.lua" file into the console. You should see a "HP Remaining: XXXXX" value in the top left of the screen.

# Note

This script probably will display whatever monster's data is at the byte mentioned in the file whenever you enter battle.
